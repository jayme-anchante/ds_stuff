* [rapids](https://rapids.ai/): The RAPIDS suite of open source software libraries gives you the freedom to execute end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines entirely on GPUs. RAPIDS is incubated by NVIDIA® based on years of accelerated data science experience. RAPIDS relies on NVIDIA CUDA® primitives for low-level compute optimization, and exposes GPU parallelism and high-bandwidth memory speed through user-friendly Python interfaces.
